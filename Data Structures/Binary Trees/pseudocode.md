# Binary Search Tree
Encompasses two classes, ```TreeNode()``` and ```BinarySearchTree()```


## ```Node``` 
Each node has three attributes, ```val```, ```left```, ```right```.

## ```BinarySearchTree```
A BinarySearchTree has two attributes, ```root``` and a ```height```.

## Tasks
Create the following methods:
1. ```pre_order_traversal```, ```post_order_traversal```, ```inorder_traversal```, ```tree_insert```.
2. ```tree_search```, ```maximum```, ```minimum```.
3. ```tree_successor```, ```tree_predecessor```.
4. ```common_ancestor```.
5. ```balance_bst```.

Create a binary search tree using your ```tree_insert``` method, implement a way to _print_ it (if not using **Python**), and successfully call all methods properly, showing accurate usage of them with your printing function. 

### Clarifications
```pass``` is inputed to avoid errors. It is not appropriate code and should not remain in your working methods.
