# Structure
Max 3 files.

## pseudocode.md
All data structures will have a file ```pseudocode.md``` that explains the task to implement in code. 

## _guided.py
The second file will be a guided file (sorry it can only be in **Python**) to help walk you through the code with comments and suggestions. It also will provide a ```main()``` for testing.

## expected_guided_output.txt
Somtimes, there will be a third file with the expected output of the guided file.
